# Exercise 8: Increasing cookies per click

In Cookie Clicker, there are two kinds of items:

- Items that increase the # of cookies per tick
- Items that increase the # of cookies per click

Right now, we've implemented the second type, but not the first. No matter what we purchase, we always earn exactly 1 cookie per click.

Add a new item type, `megaCursor`, which increases the # of cookies per click. You'll need to do some re-working of the game logic and the data format for this to work!
