# Exercise 9: Increased pricing

In Cookie Clicker, each time you buy an item, it gets more expensive; The first cursor might only cost 10 cookies, but the second one might cost 12, and then 15, and then 20. The growth rate is _non-linear_; the price doesn't go up by 2 cookies every time, for example. Instead the jump gets higher and higher with every purchase.

Implement this!
